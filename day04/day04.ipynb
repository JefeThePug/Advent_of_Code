    "Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the \n",
    "ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up \n",
    "sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is \n",
    "assigned a range of section IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each \n",
    "other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to \n",
    "quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and \n",
    "make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle \n",
    "input).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n",

    "\n",
    " - Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections \n",
    "   2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections \n",
    "   6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).\n",
    " - The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.\n",
    " - The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got \n",
    "   sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; \n",
    "your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of \n",
