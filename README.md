Advent of Code Challenges 2022

My submissions for the Advent of Code challenges for 2022.
All submissions have been accepted as correct.
I have sectioned each daily challenge into its own folder.

Included in each folder are:
- a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) with parts 1 and 2 in different 
  cells, used for testing and calculating the result
- a python file (.py) for part 1 of the question
- a python file (.py) for part 2 of the question
- a text file (.txt) containing the input supplied by the website to 
  analyze and use in deriving the challenge's solution

Please do not cheat and plagiarize my solutions when completing the 
challenges on your own.
