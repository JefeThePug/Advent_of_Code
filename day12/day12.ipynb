    "You try contacting the Elves using your handheld device, but the river \n",
    "you're following must be too low to get a decent signal.\n",

    "You ask the device for a heightmap of the surrounding area (your puzzle \n",

    "letter, where a is the lowest elevation, b is the next-lowest, and so on up \n",
    "to the highest elevation, z.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also included on the heightmap are marks for your current position (S) and \n",

    "elevation z.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'd like to reach E, but to save energy, you should do it in as few steps \n",
    "as possible. During each step, you can move exactly one square up, down, \n",
    "left, or right. To avoid needing to get out your climbing gear, the \n",
    "elevation of the destination square can be at most one higher than the \n",
    "elevation of your current square; that is, if your current elevation is m, \n",
